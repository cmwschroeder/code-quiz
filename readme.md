# Code Quiz

## Description

A coding quiz to test your knowledge on basic HTML, CSS, and javascript. In this quiz you will be presented with an intro. When clicking the begin button you will be put into the quiz and a timer will be started. The question will be shown and there will be 4 answers to pick from. If you choose the correct answer then you will simply go to the next question. If you pick the wrong answer then time will be taken off your timer and you will have less time to build up your score.  The game ends when there are no questions left or you run out of time. At the end of the quiz you will be able to save your score on the list of highscores of your local machine. After you submit you will be taken to a page that shows all of your highscores. From here you can clear the list or go back to the introduction of the quiz to retake the quiz.  At any point you can click the button on the top left labelled "display highscores" and it will take you back to the highscores page. This will end your quiz if you are in the middle of a quiz so be careful. The making of this quiz was very helpful in the understanding of applications of event listeners, the timed function, objects, and local storage.
